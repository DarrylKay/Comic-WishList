        "Frank Castle - the Punisher - is a one-man army ready to take down anyone in his way, meting out the ultimate punishment to criminals: death. The Punisher makes his return by eliminating the ruthless Ma Gnucci's crime family - pursued by the NYPD's two-detective Punisher Task Force, crazed contract killer the Russian and super hero Daredevil; and emulated by three copycat killers. The over-the-top action builds toward a showdown in Frank's apartment building. Now, Castle must survive to finish his vendetta, making sure his neighbors aren't caught in the crossfire while evil is punished. When WELCO ME BACK, FRANK debuted in 2000, writer Garth Ennis and artist Steve Dillon gave the Punisher a redefining fresh start that once more made him a force to be reckoned with and served as the catalyst for two feature films!"

        "One of the all-time great stories of the Silver Surfer, by the legendary Stan 'The Man' Lee and visionary French artist Jean Giraud, aka Moebius - as stunning now as it was 30 years ago! A star falls to earth. Panic grips the planet as mankind prepares for its inevitable end. But the star is a ship, and inside is a god. All he asks is adoration. Overcome with relief, man rushes to obey. There is only one voice of dissent that will not be silenced: the Silver Surfer, who recognizes the 'god' as his former master! But why has Galactus encouraged mankind to live down to his darkest nature? The Sentinel of the Spaceways stars in a bewitching tale of man's folly and nobility. Collecting: Silver Surfer (1988) 1-2"

He's also certifiably insane, suffering from multiple-personality disorder and haunted by the ghosts of his past. In other words, he's the perfect soldier in a Cold War where it's impossible to tell friend from foe and reality from a lie. Wilson is also the only one capable of hunting down a rogue CIA agent and recovering the stolen nuclear suitcase she's carrying before she hands it over to America's enemies.
